## Basic forms

The `ui-form`</code> component allows you to generate forms with the minimal amount of code possible. 

It's built as a small abstraction over [ngx-formly](https://github.com/formly-js/ngx-formly) and should
support all of it's functionality. If not, then this is a bug.

The fields of the form are defined in an array. The items in the array
can be created using the `Field` helper class.
